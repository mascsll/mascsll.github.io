                <strong>Talk Title:</strong><br>
                <i>Beyond Generation: Language Models as Creativity Evaluators</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                <i>Creativity is a multifaceted process, encompassing not only the generation of ideas but also the evaluation of their originality and impact. Although language models (LMs) can generate new content, their capacity for evaluating creative work—a subjective judgment traditionally requiring human expertise and nuanced understanding—has received less attention. This talk shifts the focus from generation to evaluation, exploring how LMs can be trained to assess creative outputs across diverse domains, from literature to science. I will present in-context learning and fine-tuning approaches, leveraging established psychological assessment techniques to develop robust datasets of human creativity judgments. Our studies show that LM evaluations achieve high correlation with expert ratings across diverse creativity tasks, reaching inter-rater agreement comparable to human judges. This automated creativity evaluation enables AI-powered tools that can augment human creativity through real-time feedback, helping people learn to better evaluate their own ideas. It also opens the door to a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the creative potential of LMs and the possibility of training more creative AI models. I will conclude with future work toward mechanistic understanding of LM creativity and discuss some broader implications of creative AI for the arts and sciences.</i>

                Xiang Lorraine Li is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Her research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning, in particular, she's interested in understanding model behavior via evaluation benchmark design and exploration around the meaning of model parameters in complex or long-tail situations, for example, high-impact domains such as law and education. By doing this, she aims to construct socially responsible, equitable, and robust models that cater to diverse users, populations, cultures, and scenarios. Her research plan on building pluralistic models is presented in the AAAI new faculty highlight in 2025, and he work has been published in NLP and ML conferences. She worked as a young investigator with Yejin Choi at AI2 before joining Pitt. Previously, she defended her Ph.D. in Computer Science from UMass Amherst in August 2022, working with Andrew McCallum.

                <strong>Talk Title:</strong><br>
                <i>Every Opinion Matters: Distributional and Long-tail Evaluation for LLMs</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Human knowledge is inherently probabilistic and structured with multiple correct answers. For example, the purpose of "boiling water" could be cooking or making tea. However, people in areas with limited access to clean water might view it as a way to remove germs and ensure it's safe to drink. Unfortunately, this aspect is often overlooked in the current LLM evaluation. To ensure that models can serve diverse populations, it is important to gather multiple responses from a wide range of people and pay extra attention to rare, yet plausible and important, situations.
                <br>
                This talk will highlight the limitations of current LLMs in terms of their abilities around distribution and long-tail situations. I will discuss two benchmarks for evaluating commonsense in LLMs. One introduces a method for retrieving commonsense question-answer distributions from human annotators, and the other focuses on assessing the long-tail (uncommon) aspects of commonsense knowledge. The new evaluation benchmarks aim to shed light on making LLMs more robust to long-tail knowledge and better catering to diverse populations.

                <i>Troubles with Training Data for Large Language Models</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Language models are trained on billions of words of text. Where does that text come from and how is it processed and filtered on its way to becoming training data? In this talk, we will examine how seemingly small decisions made when preparing pre-training data can have a significant impact on observed model performance. We will also discuss the problems with relying on the Internet as a primary source for training data. Gradual shifts in how content is posted on the web will limit its future usefulness as training data, and since the Internet is public, anyone can edit it, including adversaries aiming to introduce undesirable behaviours by inserting poisoned text.

    <strong>Title:</strong><br>"Not so fast!": Revisiting assumptions in (and about) Natural Language Reasoning<br>
    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>In recent years, the field of Natural Language Processing has seen a profusion of tasks, datasets, and systems that facilitate reasoning about real-world situations through language (e.g., RTE, MNLI, COMET). Such systems might, for example, be trained to consider a situation where "somebody dropped a glass on the floor," and conclude it is likely that "the glass shattered" as a result. In this talk, I will discuss three pieces of work that revisit assumptions made by or about these systems. In the first work, I develop a Defeasible Inference task, which enables a system to recognize when a prior assumption it has made may no longer be true in light of new evidence it receives. The second work I will discuss revisits partial-input baselines, which have highlighted issues of spurious correlations in natural language reasoning datasets and led to unfavorable assumptions about models' reasoning abilities. In particular, I will discuss experiments that show models may still learn to reason in the presence of spurious dataset artifacts. Finally, I will touch on work analyzing harmful assumptions made by reasoning models in the form of social stereotypes, and how these stereotypes may be uncovered automatically.<br>
