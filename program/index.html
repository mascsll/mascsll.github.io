                Roger Beaty is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Penn State University. His research delves into the neural and cognitive underpinnings of creative thinking, utilizing tools like fMRI and neuromodulation (e.g., tES-fNIRS) to explore brain network dynamics and causally test neurocognitive mechanisms. By linking brain activity during creative tasks to processes like memory, attention, and cognitive control, and developing open-access resources for measuring creativity, his work aims to enhance creativity across domains like musical improvisation and scientific problem-solving. After earning a BA in psychology at Temple University, a PhD at University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) with Paul Silvia, and completing postdoctoral training in cognitive neuroscience at Harvard University with Daniel Schacter, he joined Penn State’s Department of Psychology in 2018 as an assistant professor.

                Xiang Lorraine Li is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Her research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning, in particular, she's interested in understanding model behavior via evaluation benchmark design and exploration around the meaning of model parameters in complex or long-tail situations, for example, high-impact domains such as law and education. By doing this, she aims to construct socially responsible, equitable, and robust models that cater to diverse users, populations, cultures, and scenarios. Her research plan on building puristic models is presented in the AAAI new faculty highlight in 2025, and he work has been published in NLP and ML conferences. She worked as a young investigator with Yejin Choi at AI2 before joining Pitt. Previously, she defended her Ph.D. in Computer Science from UMass Amherst in August 2022, working with Andrew McCallum.

    <strong>Title:</strong><br>“Not so fast!”: Revisiting assumptions in (and about) Natural Language Reasoning<br>
    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>In recent years, the field of Natural Language Processing has seen a profusion of tasks, datasets, and systems that facilitate reasoning about real-world situations through language (e.g., RTE, MNLI, COMET). Such systems might, for example, be trained to consider a situation where “somebody dropped a glass on the floor,” and conclude it is likely that “the glass shattered” as a result. In this talk, I will discuss three pieces of work that revisit assumptions made by or about these systems. In the first work, I develop a Defeasible Inference task, which enables a system to recognize when a prior assumption it has made may no longer be true in light of new evidence it receives. The second work I will discuss revisits partial-input baselines, which have highlighted issues of spurious correlations in natural language reasoning datasets and led to unfavorable assumptions about models’ reasoning abilities. In particular, I will discuss experiments that show models may still learn to reason in the presence of spurious dataset artifacts. Finally, I will touch on work analyzing harmful assumptions made by reasoning models in the form of social stereotypes, and how these stereotypes may be uncovered automatically.<br>
