        The 8th annual <strong>Mid-Atlantic Student Colloquium on Speech, Language and Learning</strong> will be hosted at the University of Maryland, College Park on <strong>March 6th, 2020</strong>. The Student Colloquium is intended to bring together students taking computational approaches to speech, language, and learning, so that they can introduce their research to the local student community, give and receive feedback, and engage each other in collaborative discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students are encouraged to submit abstracts describing ongoing, planned or completed research projects, including previously published results and negative results. Student research in any field applying computational methods to any aspect of human language, including speech and learning, from all areas of computer science, linguistics, engineering, neuroscience, information science, and related fields, is welcome. Submissions and presentations must be made by students or postdocs. Accepted submissions will be presented as either posters or talks.
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be no registration fee. Students and postdocs are encouraged to consult with their supervisors about potential reimbursement of travel expenses.
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract Submission</h2>
    <p> 
        Submit your abstract online via the 2020 MASC-SLL EasyChair site 
        <center>
            <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mascsll2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mascsll2020</a>
        </center>
    </p>
    <p>
        Abstracts should be no more than one page, not including references. If an under-review or published paper has more than one page, the authors need to submit a one-page version of the paper. Abstracts should conform to ACL style guidelines. LaTeX and Word style files, along with a style guide, are available at <a href="https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/">ACL 2020 call for papers</a> (<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd">OverLeaf<a>, <a href="http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip">LaTeX</a>). Abstract reviewing will NOT be blind. Please include all names and affiliations in the abstract. All accepted abstracts will be non-archival; authors can submit them to subsequent conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cross-Submission Policy</strong>: MASC-SLL 2020 welcomes submissions that are under review or have been published at recent scientific conferences. Please make sure that submitting to a non-archival venue is allowed by the conference your work is submitting to or published at. At the time of submission, we will ask you to indicate whether your work is unpublished, under review or published.
